Rates are based on eligibility under SC-2D, SC-3, SC-3A, SC-4, or SC-7. Specific rate components are determined by negotiated Customer Service Agreements or standardized discounts as per Sections 5 and 6 of this classification. Minimum bill provisions apply. No explicit rate components (customer charge, energy charge, demand charge, reactive charge) are defined in this text. Refer to the applicable standard tariff rates (SC-2D, SC-3, SC-3A, SC-4, SC-7) for base rate details. This classification acts as a contract vehicle for discounted or negotiated rates and does not itself specify fixed charges or formulas.",
