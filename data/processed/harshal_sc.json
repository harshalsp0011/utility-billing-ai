Service under this Service Classification is primarily intended for residential customers residing in individual\ndwelling units.\n1. When minor professional or commercial operations are conducted within the individual dwelling unit,\nservice under this Service Classification will be permitted providing all of the following three qualifications\nare met:\na. The minor professional or commercial operations must be exclusively by the residential\ncustomer residing at the individual dwelling unit served. Use of the professional or commercial area\nby another professional person or persons in addition to the resident disqualifies the customer to\nreceive Electric Service or Electricity Supply Service under this Service Classification.\nb. The area used by the minor professional or commercial operations does not exceed 50 percent\nof the total cubical content of the individual dwelling unit.\nc.

If the customer starts budget billing as of the last\nbill, the last bill is canceled and rebilled under budget billing. The initial budget amount is based on an average\nof the preceding twelve months of actual and estimated energy related charges.\nMonthly budget amounts are reviewed on a ongoing basis and may be changed, as needed, to produce level\nbudget billings through the end of the budget period. The difference between the actual and billed charges will\nbe maintained as a deferred balance. If the Customer decides to end involvement with the program or end\nservice with the Company, the deferred balance will be settled or rolled over for all customers in the twelfth\nmonth.\nBudget bills are due and payable. Full payment must be received on or before the date shown on the bill to\navoid a late payment charge of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) pursuant to Rule 26.4. If the customer fails to\npay the monthly Budget Amount or upon discontinuance of service, the Monthly Budget Payment Plan will be\ncanceled and any deficiency shall be due and payable at once, including any late payment charges assessed.\nAny overpayment shall be credited to the customer's account. The customer can cancel the plan at any time\neffective with the customer\u2019s next regularly scheduled billing.\nThe Company will make available a budget brochure explaining how the Monthly Budget Payment Plan works.\nIssued by Sally Librera, President, Syracuse, NY\nStatus: EFFECTIVE\nReceived: 08/27/2025 Effective Date: 09/01/2025\nPSC NO: 220 ELECTRICITY LEAF: 352\nNIAGARA MOHAWK POWER CORPORATION REVISION: 2\nINITIAL EFFECTIVE DATE: SEPTEMBER 1, 2025 SUPERSEDING REVISION: 0\nSTAMPS: Issued in Compliance with Order in Case 24-E-0322, dated August 14, 2025.\nSERVICE CLASSIFICATION NO. 1 (Continued)\nSPECIAL PROVISIONS (CONT.)\nC.
