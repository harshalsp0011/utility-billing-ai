When minor professional or commercial operations are conducted within the individual dwelling units, service under this Service Classification will be permitted providing all of the following three qualifications are met: a. The minor professional or commercial operations must be exclusively by the residential customer residing at the individual dwelling unit served. Use of the professional or commercial area by another professional person or persons in addition to the resident disqualifies the customer to receive Electric Service or Electricity Supply Service under this Service Classification. b. The area used by the minor professional or commercial operations does not exceed 50 percent of the total cubical content of the individual dwelling unit. c. Not more than two (2) rooms of any size are contained within the 50 percent cubical content of the area used for professional or commercial operations. Residential customers having professional or commercial operations within an individual dwelling unit that do not meet all of the three qualifications must take service under the General Service Classification. Such customers however, can elect to separate the electrical use between the residential area and the area used for professional or commercial operations and to have the Company set an additional meter. The meter used to measure the electrical use in the professional or commercial operations area will be billed under the General Service Classification. Residential status will not begin earlier than the October, 1991, meter reading for customers eligible for service under this service classification based on the following applicability clause: \"residential purposes in a multiple occupancy building where not more than two individual flats, apartments or divided living spaces are available\".",
      "B": "Customers, in good standing, have the option, with the consent of the Company, of paying for service under the Company's Monthly Budget Plan. The plan covers up to twelve months billing and can be started at the customer's option either with the next bill or as of the last bill. If the customer starts budget billing as of the last bill, the last bill is canceled and is rebilled under budget billing. The initial budget amount is based on an average of the preceding twelve months of actual and estimated energy related charges. Monthly budget amounts are reviewed on an ongoing basis and may be changed, as needed, to produce level budget billings through the end of the budget period. The difference between the actual and billed charges will be maintained as a deferred balance. If the Customer decides to end involvement with the program or end service with the Company, the deferred balance will be settled or rolled over for all customers in the twelfth month. Budget bills are due and payable when rendered. Full payment must be received on or before the date shown on the bill to avoid a late payment charge of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) pursuant to Rule 26.4. If the customer fails to pay the monthly Budget Amount of upon discontinuance of service, the Monthly Budget Payment Plan will be canceled and any deficiency shall be due and payable at once, including any late payment charges assessed. Any overpayment shall be credited to the customer's account. The customer can cancel the plan at any time effective with the customer\u2019s next regularly scheduled billing.",

(1) RELIGIOUS PURPOSE The organization shall have a fundamental religious purpose and the property shall be used primarily in support of its purpose. (2) EVIDENCE OF ELIGIBILITY Qualifying religious organizations are eligible for the residential rate. In order to be a qualified religious organization, the organization shall submit evidence of eligibility, which may include any of the following: copies of articles of incorporation as religious corporations, charters, letters from recognized religious organizations, eligibility designations from the Internal Revenue Service and other documentation of the religious nature of the organization. The Company shall not require proof of tax-exempt status as a condition for a religious organization or body to receive the rates under this service classification, although a tax-exempt certificate can be supplied and accepted as supplement to the customer's proof of eligibility. A Company representative(s) interview with the religious organization representative(s) or observations of the organization\u2019s activities may also supplement proof of eligibility. (3) RELIGIOUS AND NON-RELIGIOUS USE Electricity will not be supplied under this Service Classification unless the predominant use of the premises is to carry out religious purposes and or/is reasonably incidental to the religious purpose. Where religious activities and/or activities which are reasonably incidental to the religious purpose take place in the same metered facility with, and share the same space with activities that are neither religious nor reasonably incidental to religious purposes, a predominant use calculation may be employed to determine whether the predominant use of this space is for religious (or reasonably incidental) purposes, as opposed to other purposes, and to determine the applicability of this rate. i. Where non-religious uses (meaning use which is neither for religious nor for reasonably incidental purposes) are found to predominate, and such uses can be physically segregated and separately metered and billed from the religious use, the portion of the premises involving religious uses will, provided the customer elects to make the necessary wiring changes that are the customer\u2019s responsibility, receive service under this Service Classification and the portion of the premises involving non-religious uses will receive service under the appropriate non-residential Service Classification. ii. Where non-religious uses predominate and such uses cannot be physically segregated and separately metered and billed, the entire premise will receive service under the appropriate non-residential Service Classification. (4) NON-QUALIFYING USES Certain uses by religious organizations are typically not eligible for the residential rate, including but not limited to: 1. Colleges or Universities 2. Nursing Schools or Medical Schools 3. Hospitals 4. Nursing and Adult Homes 5. Recreational Facilities, Health Clubs or Physical Fitness Facilities 6.

Customers served under this Special Provision L and who take electricity supply service from the Company will be billed at hourly day-ahead market prices as described in Rule 46 herein. All Customers regardless of voltage level or electricity supplier, who meet the size requirement described above will be required to install an interval meter at the Customer Premises and will be subject to an incremental customer charge of 25.1 per month, except Service Classification No. 12 customers who have existing contracts that preclude pricing adjustments.
