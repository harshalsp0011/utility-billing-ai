Service under this Service Classification is primarily intended for residential customers residing in individual\ndwelling units.\n1. When minor professional or commercial operations are conducted within the individual dwelling unit,\nservice under this Service Classification will be permitted providing all of the following three qualifications\nare met:\na. The minor professional or commercial operations must be exclusively by the residential\ncustomer residing at the individual dwelling unit served. Use of the professional or commercial area\nby another professional person or persons in addition to the resident disqualifies the customer to\nreceive Electric Service or Electricity Supply Service under this Service Classification.\nb. The area used by the minor professional or commercial operations does not exceed 50 percent\nof the total cubical content of the individual dwelling unit.\nc.

If the customer starts budget billing as of the last\nbill, the last bill is canceled and rebilled under budget billing. The initial budget amount is based on an average\nof the preceding twelve months of actual and estimated energy related charges.\nMonthly budget amounts are reviewed on a ongoing basis and may be changed, as needed, to produce level\nbudget billings through the end of the budget period. The difference between the actual and billed charges will\nbe maintained as a deferred balance. If the Customer decides to end involvement with the program or end\nservice with the Company, the deferred balance will be settled or rolled over for all customers in the twelfth\nmonth.\nBudget bills are due and payable. Full payment must be received on or before the date shown on the bill to\navoid a late payment charge of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) pursuant to Rule 26.4. If the customer fails to\npay the monthly Budget Amount or upon discontinuance of service, the Monthly Budget Payment Plan will be\ncanceled and any deficiency shall be due and payable at once, including any late payment charges assessed.\nAny overpayment shall be credited to the customer's account. The customer can cancel the plan at any time\neffective with the customer\u2019s next regularly scheduled billing.\nThe Company will make available a budget brochure explaining how the Monthly Budget Payment Plan works.\nIssued by Sally Librera, President, Syracuse, NY\nStatus: EFFECTIVE\nReceived: 08/27/2025 Effective Date: 09/01/2025\nPSC NO: 220 ELECTRICITY LEAF: 352\nNIAGARA MOHAWK POWER CORPORATION REVISION: 2\nINITIAL EFFECTIVE DATE: SEPTEMBER 1, 2025 SUPERSEDING REVISION: 0\nSTAMPS: Issued in Compliance with Order in Case 24-E-0322, dated August 14, 2025.\nSERVICE CLASSIFICATION NO. 1 (Continued)\nSPECIAL PROVISIONS (CONT.)\nC.

A demand meter shall be installed whenever the monthly energy consumption for any four consecutive months of a\ncustomer exceeds 2000 kWh per month or whenever the connected load of customer indicates that the energy\nconsumption will exceed 2000 kWh per month. A demand meter, once installed, shall not be removed until after the\nenergy consumption has been less than 2000 kWh per month for twelve consecutive months, which requirement may\nnot be avoided by temporarily terminating service.\nB. The Distribution Delivery demand shall be the highest average kW measured in a fifteen-minute interval during\nthe billing period, but not less than one kW nor less than the demand contracted for.\nTERMS OF PAYMENT:\nBills are due and payable when rendered. Full payment must be received on or before the date shown on the bill to\navoid a late payment charge of one and one-half percent (l l/2%) pursuant to Rule 26.4.\nTERM:\nOne month and continuously from month to month thereafter until permanently terminated on three days\u2019 notice to\nCompany, or one year and thereafter until terminated as provided in the written application for service.\nSPECIAL PROVISIONS:\nA. Whenever metered service presents safety or environmental risks and/or is inappropriate for the specific\napplication, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall offer unmetered service provided the total load and\noperating schedule is pre-determined where, the kWh use can be computed and not measured. Unmetered\nService will be charged the Standard tariff for Metered Non-Demand Service using their computed kWh\nusage.\nB. At the sole discretion of the Company, ancillary devices having individually assigned small electric load\nenergy consumption characteristics, authorized as licensed attachments per the terms and conditions of a\nseparate, mutually executed Attachment Agreement, and using single-phase, secondary service voltage\nsourced directly from the Company\u2019s electric distribution system or indirectly using an alternate electric\ndistribution source may be billed unmetered under this rate. Ancillary device unmetered energy\nconsumption, determined as kWh, shall be determined based upon the device manufacturer\u2019s specified\nindividual maximum wattage, operating on a constant 24 hour-7 day per week schedule. The billable\nunmetered energy consumption of devices interconnected to form a complete operating attachment device\nassembly at a single location shall be determined as the cumulative maximum wattage of all individual\ndevices. Billing of ancillary device service will be assigned to and made the responsibility of the primary\ncustomer of record that is obtaining service from the electric distribution system referred to as direct\nservice. The service to an ancillary device or device assembly will require the installation of a Company\napproved disconnect device and the appropriate electrical circuit grounding.
