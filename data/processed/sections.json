A CDG project that has been removed from the CDG Net Crediting Program is\npermitted to: 1) return to the CDG program, 2) re-enroll in CDG Net Crediting Program following\nthe requirements provided in the CDG Net Crediting Manual, or 3) switch to Remote Crediting\nunder Rule 66.\nProjects that elect to return to CDG or switch to Remote Crediting will forfeit the crediting\nmethodology in CDG Net Crediting that eliminates a separate participation payment from the\nsatellite to the host. Once removed from the CDG Net Crediting Program, the Company will apply\nthe full value of the Value Stack credit to the satellite as dictated on the allocation form without\nany separate payment to the host or deduction of the utility administration fee.\nNon-Value Stack CDG or RNM projects that opt into the CDG Net Crediting will forfeit any\nbanked volumetric credits on the existing projects before commencing with the CDG Net\nCrediting program. Value Stack CDG or Remote Crediting projects that opt into the CDG Net\nCrediting will retain any banked monetary credits on the existing projects that will become the\nstarting balance of the new CDG Net Crediting project\u2019s host bank.\n29.4.2 Determination of CDG Satellite\u2019s Net Member Credits\nThe Company will calculate and apply a Net Member Credit to the participating CDG Satellite\u2019s\nretail bill based on the CDG project\u2019s net injections and associated Value Stack Compensation, as\ndetermined in accordance with Rule 40 and each applicable billing period, with modifications as\nfollows.\nNet Member Credits for each CDG Satellite shall be determined as that CDG Satellites\u2019 Savings\nRate multiplied by the CDG Satellite\u2019s Calculated Credits. The Calculated Credits for each\nparticipating CDG Satellite will be determined as the minimum of i) the Total Available Credit\nand ii) the CDG Satellite\u2019s total electric retail bill charges for the applicable billing period. The\nTotal Available Credit shall be determined as the sum of i) the CDG project\u2019s Value Stack\nCompensation for the applicable billing period as calculated in conformance with Rule 40,\nmultiplied by the CDG Satellite\u2019s Allocation Percentage; and ii) any retained credits that have\nbeen banked or re-allocated to the CDG Satellite\u2019s account.\nAny remainder of Net Member Credit that has not been used to credit the CDG Satellite\u2019s current\nelectric utility bill for the applicable billing period will be banked on the CDG Satellite\u2019s account\nfor future use.

The CDG Host will provide the\nnecessary payment information as described in the CDG Net Crediting Manual.\nThe CDG Host Payment is the sum of the CDG Subscription Fees calculated for each of the\nproject\u2019s CDG Satellites in the applicable period less the Utility Administrative Fee to be retained\nby the Company as further described below. The CDG Subscription Fee will be determined for\neach CDG Satellite, excluding Excluded Anchor Satellites, as the Calculated Credits, less the Net\nMember Credits. The Utility Administration Fee will be determined each billing period as 1% of\nthe sum of the Calculated Credits and will be retained by the Company to support implementation\nand ongoing costs of the program.\nNotwithstanding the above, prior to automation of the above crediting mechanisms in the\nCompany\u2019s billing system, the CDG Host Payments will be determined as a result of the interim\nmanual crediting calculation methodology described in the CDG Net Crediting Manual.\n29.4.4 Excluded Anchor Satellites\nThe CDG Host may choose to designate multiple CDG Satellites to be an Excluded Anchor Satellite,\nlimited in aggregate up to 40 percent of the total CDG Project\u2019s monthly allocation. Excluded\nAnchor Satellites may not be a mass market customer, as defined in Rule 36.1.9. The selection of\nExcluded Anchor Satellites must be made in accordance with the procedures in the CDG Net\nCrediting Manual and provided via the Company portal no later than thirty days prior to the CDG\nHost account\u2019s billing date from which Excluded Anchor Satellites will receive credits. Excluded\nAnchor Satellites will not be assigned a CDG Savings Rate and their Net Member Credit will be equal\nto the Calculated Credits as calculated in 29.4.2.\n29.4.5 Unallocated Credits\nIn the event the sum of the CDG Satellite\u2019s allocation percentages, including Excluded Anchor\nSatellites, if applicable, for a CDG project are less than 100.00% in any applicable billing period, the\ndifference will be the Unallocated Satellite Percentage. The Unallocated Satellite Percentage will be\nmultiplied by the CDG project\u2019s Value Stack Compensation for the applicable billing period,\nexcluding any Community Credits, as determined in accordance with Rule 40, to determine the\nUnallocated Credits.

Depreciation expense for the Overhead Facilities will be\ncomputed by applying the approved depreciation rates, in effect at the time the initial\nsurcharge calculation is made for any municipality, to the book cost of the Overhead\nFacilities.\n32.2.2.3 Rate of Return Component\nThe rate of return component will be computed by applying the overall pre-tax rate of\nreturn reflected in the rates resulting from the Company\u2019s most recent electric rate\nproceeding, including all income tax effects thereon, to the incremental capital costs of the\nUnderground Facilities.\nIssued by Sally Librera, President, Syracuse, NY",

NYSERDA LOAN INSTALLMENT PROGRAM\n51.1 On August 4, 2011, the Power NY Act of 2011 was enacted which amends the Public Service Law to\naddress the establishment of the Green Jobs-Green New York Program administered by the New York State\nEnergy Research and Development Authority (\u201cNYSERDA\u201d) or its designated agent. This program provides\nfor an on-bill recovery mechanism for certain qualified residential and non-residential customers to pay back\nloans for energy efficiency improvements approved and obtained through NYSERDA (\u201cNYSERDA Loan\nInstallment Program\u201d). As set forth in this law, the Company will bill and collect NYSERDA Loan Installment\namounts on a customer\u2019s utility bill when notified by NYSERDA that these NYSERDA Loan Installments\napply to the customer\u2019s utility account. Unless otherwise precluded by law, participation in the NYSERDA\nLoan Installment Program shall not affect a customer\u2019s eligibility for any rebate or incentive offered by the\nCompany. In order to comply with the requirements set forth in the Power NY Act of 2011, the Company will\nprovide NYSERDA, or its agents, certain customer information and take other actions for purposes of the\nNYSERDA Loan Installment Program. The Company will implement the NYSERDA Loan Installment\nProgram no later than May 30, 2012.\n51.1.1 All customer information released to NYSERDA by the Company will be considered\nconfidential. Customers making application to NYSERDA under the NYSERDA Loan Installment\nProgram will be required to provide consent for NYSERDA\u2019s use of the customer\u2019s utility account\ninformation. For premises with an outstanding NYSERDA Installment Loan, the Company will release\nto NYSERDA each successor customer\u2019s information pursuant to the requirements of the Power NY Act\nof 2011.\n51.1.2 The number of customers that may participate in the NYSERDA Loan Installment Program\nunder this Rule will initially be limited to no more than one-half of one percent of the Company's total\n2011 customer population as reported to the Commission in the Company\u2019s PSC Annual Report, as of\nDecember 31, 2011, on a first-come, first-served basis.\n51.2 NYSERDA will have direct responsibility for advising the Company of the NYSERDA Loan Installment\namount and loan term in months to be billed for each customer NYSERDA has advanced monies under the\nNYSERDA Loan Installment Program. The responsibility of the Company is limited to providing billing and\ncollection services for NYSERDA. Such billing and collection services will be available regardless of whether\nthe electricity or gas delivered by the Company is the customer\u2019s primary energy source. The Company will\ncommence charging the NYSERDA Loan Installment on the customer\u2019s next cycle bill for utility service after\nnotification by NYSERDA, if practical, but not later than the second billing cycle after receipt of the\nnotification. For each monthly period billed, the Company will include the monthly NYSERDA Loan\nInstallment amount until the NYSERDA Loan Installment obligation is satisfied or the account is closed. A\nmonthly billing period will be defined as any billing period of not less than twenty-five calendar days\nIssued by Kenneth D. Daly, President, Syracuse, NY",

Remote Crediting Hosts must notify the\nCompany if a Remote Crediting Satellite has multiple Remote Crediting Hosts on any allocation\nform submitted to the Company.\nRemote Crediting Satellites that participate in multiple Remote Crediting projects or are\nCustomer-Generators are limited to a cumulative total of 5 MW of installed capacity allocated to\nthe Remote Crediting Satellite account as determined by adding the total installed on-site capacity\nto the allocated capacity from all Remote Crediting projects of which the Remote Crediting\nSatellite is a participant.\nIf it is determined that the Remote Crediting Satellite account is receiving more than the\naggregated capacity of 5 MW, the Company will suspend any application of credits to the Remote\nCrediting Satellite and those credits will remain with the appropriate Remote Crediting Host\nbanks. Allocation of credits to the Remote Crediting Satellite will resume once the sum of the\nRemote Crediting Host allocations does not exceed 5 MW.\nThe Remote Crediting Host must certify in writing to the Company, both prior to commencing\nRemote Crediting and with each allocation form submitted, that it has met all program criteria set\nforth in Commission\u2019s orders and detailed in the Company\u2019s tariff, including, but not limited to,\ncertifying that the cumulative total installed capacity of each Remote Crediting Satellites does not\nexceed 5 MW.\nIn the event a Remote Crediting Satellite participates in multiple Remote Crediting projects, the\nValue Stack credit applied to the satellite account\u2019s current electric charges will be determined on\na pro rata basis based on each Remote Crediting Host\u2019s total allocation to the satellite in that\nbilling period.

If the Remote Crediting allocation list totals less than\n100 percent, the unallocated portion will be applied to the Remote Crediting Host account bank.\nAllocations that total more than 100% shall be rejected by the Company and the Remote Crediting\nHost will be required to revise and resubmit the Remote Crediting allocation form. By including a\ncustomer account number on the allocation form, the Remote Crediting Host certifies they have\nreceived written authorization from the customer to allocate credits to the customer\u2019s account.\nThe Remote Crediting Host is permitted to receive no allocation of credits by indicating such on\nthe allocation form. This exclusion is permitted only on the Remote Crediting Host account on\nwhich the generating asset is located. In the event a Remote Crediting Host chooses not to receive\nmonthly allocations, yet credits are held in the host bank, the Remote Crediting Host\u2019s electric\ncharges will be offset by those credits in the host bank.\nIf no allocation form is provided by the Remote Crediting Host to the Company within thirty (30)\ndays of interconnection to the Company\u2019s distribution system, all Value Stack compensation will,\nafter satisfying all electric charges of the Remote Crediting Host, be allocated to the Remote\nCrediting Host bank. Until such time as a completed allocation form is received and accepted by\nthe Company, any excess credit remaining in the Remote Crediting Host bank after satisfying all\nelectric charges of the Remote Crediting Host will continue to be banked and available for future\nRemote Crediting Host bank allocation.\n66.4.1 Remote Crediting Monthly Allocations:\nThe Remote Crediting Host may modify its associated satellite accounts and/or the\npercentage allocated to such satellites by submitting a revised allocation form to the\nCompany with the new percentages and new satellite accounts with no less than thirty\n(30) days\u2019 notice before the Remote Crediting Host account\u2019s billing date to which the\nmodifications are intended to apply.\n66.4.2 Remote Crediting Host Bank Allocations:\nThe Remote Crediting Host may allocate any portion of credits banked on its account to\nany active, participating satellites as well as to its host account. Remote Crediting Hosts\nare required to furnish to the Company, with no less than thirty (30) days\u2019 notice before\nthe Remote Crediting Host\u2019s account\u2019s billing date to which the modifications apply, an\nallocation form for disbursement of credits banked on the Remote Crediting Host.

A demand meter shall be installed whenever the monthly energy consumption for any four consecutive months of a\ncustomer exceeds 2000 kWh per month or whenever the connected load of customer indicates that the energy\nconsumption will exceed 2000 kWh per month. A demand meter, once installed, shall not be removed until after the\nenergy consumption has been less than 2000 kWh per month for twelve consecutive months, which requirement may\nnot be avoided by temporarily terminating service.\nB. The Distribution Delivery demand shall be the highest average kW measured in a fifteen-minute interval during\nthe billing period, but not less than one kW nor less than the demand contracted for.\nTERMS OF PAYMENT:\nBills are due and payable when rendered. Full payment must be received on or before the date shown on the bill to\navoid a late payment charge of one and one-half percent (l l/2%) pursuant to Rule 26.4.\nTERM:\nOne month and continuously from month to month thereafter until permanently terminated on three days\u2019 notice to\nCompany, or one year and thereafter until terminated as provided in the written application for service.\nSPECIAL PROVISIONS:\nA. Whenever metered service presents safety or environmental risks and/or is inappropriate for the specific\napplication, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall offer unmetered service provided the total load and\noperating schedule is pre-determined where, the kWh use can be computed and not measured. Unmetered\nService will be charged the Standard tariff for Metered Non-Demand Service using their computed kWh\nusage.\nB. At the sole discretion of the Company, ancillary devices having individually assigned small electric load\nenergy consumption characteristics, authorized as licensed attachments per the terms and conditions of a\nseparate, mutually executed Attachment Agreement, and using single-phase, secondary service voltage\nsourced directly from the Company\u2019s electric distribution system or indirectly using an alternate electric\ndistribution source may be billed unmetered under this rate. Ancillary device unmetered energy\nconsumption, determined as kWh, shall be determined based upon the device manufacturer\u2019s specified\nindividual maximum wattage, operating on a constant 24 hour-7 day per week schedule. The billable\nunmetered energy consumption of devices interconnected to form a complete operating attachment device\nassembly at a single location shall be determined as the cumulative maximum wattage of all individual\ndevices. Billing of ancillary device service will be assigned to and made the responsibility of the primary\ncustomer of record that is obtaining service from the electric distribution system referred to as direct\nservice. The service to an ancillary device or device assembly will require the installation of a Company\napproved disconnect device and the appropriate electrical circuit grounding. The Company\u2019s electric\nservice responsibilities associated with ancillary device service will be consistent with the service quality\nand reliability provided to outdoor lighting service consistent with the Company\u2019s scheduled service\nresponse. Unauthorized devices will be considered the responsibility of the primary customer of record\nfrom which the service used by the device is provided and shall be managed and/or terminated in\ncompliance with the applicable provisions of the tariff or Attachment Agreement. Unmetered service under\nthis provision may be terminated by any responsible party per the applicable provisions of this tariff or the\nterms and conditions of the Attachment Agreement provided written notice is issued to all parties no less\nthan 30 days prior to termination.\nIssued by Sally Librera, President, Syracuse, NY",

At the sole discretion of the Company, ancillary devices having individually assigned small electric load\nenergy consumption characteristics, authorized as licensed attachments per the terms and conditions of a\nseparate, mutually executed Attachment Agreement, and using single-phase, secondary service voltage\nsourced directly from the Company\u2019s electric distribution system or indirectly using an alternate electric\ndistribution source may be billed unmetered under this rate. Ancillary device unmetered energy\nconsumption, determined as kWh, shall be determined based upon the device manufacturer\u2019s specified\nindividual maximum wattage, operating on a constant 24 hour-7 day per week schedule. The billable\nunmetered energy consumption of devices interconnected to form a complete operating attachment device\nassembly at a single location shall be determined as the cumulative maximum wattage of all individual\ndevices. Billing of ancillary device service will be assigned to and made the responsibility of the primary\ncustomer of record that is obtaining service from the electric distribution system referred to as direct\nservice. The service to an ancillary device or device assembly will require the installation of a Company\napproved disconnect device and the appropriate electrical circuit grounding. The Company\u2019s electric\nservice responsibilities associated with ancillary device service will be consistent with the service quality\nand reliability provided to outdoor lighting service consistent with the Company\u2019s scheduled service\nresponse. Unauthorized devices will be considered the responsibility of the primary customer of record\nfrom which the service used by the device is provided and shall be managed and/or terminated in\ncompliance with the applicable provisions of the tariff or Attachment Agreement. Unmetered service under\nthis provision may be terminated by any responsible party per the applicable provisions of this tariff or the\nterms and conditions of the Attachment Agreement provided written notice is issued to all parties no less\nthan 30 days prior to termination.\nIssued by Sally Librera, President, Syracuse, NY",

If\nthe generating facility\u2019s output multiplied by the Recipient Account\u2019s Percentage Allocation\nexceeds the demand registered on the Recipient Account\u2019s meter, the excess amount shall not be\nredistributed to other accounts nor carried forward to the succeeding billing period.\n\u201cAllocated Generator Supply\u201d means, for each Recipient Account, the lower of: (a) the total kWh\nregistered on the Recipient Account\u2019s meter(s) or (b) the total kWh registered on the meter(s)\nmeasuring the generating facility\u2019s output multiplied by that Recipient Account\u2019s Percentage\nAllocation. If the generating facility\u2019s output multiplied by the Recipient Account\u2019s Percentage\nAllocation exceeds the kWh registered on the Recipient Account(s) meter(s), the excess amount\nmay be credited to the extent described in Special Provision (I)(a)(6) of this Service Classification.\n\u201cPercentage Allocation\u201d means the percentage of the generating facility\u2019s output that the Sponsor\nhas allocated to each Recipient Account under the Multi-Party Offset. A single percentage will be\napplied to both the Allocated As-Used Generator Demand and the Allocated Generator Supply.\nIssued by Rudolph L. Wynter, President, Syracuse, NY",
