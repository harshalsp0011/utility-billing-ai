Ancillary device unmetered energy\nconsumption, determined as kWh, shall be determined based upon the device manufacturer\u2019s specified\nindividual maximum wattage, operating on a constant 24 hour-7 day per week schedule. The billable\nunmetered energy consumption of devices interconnected to form a complete operating attachment device\nassembly at a single location shall be determined as the cumulative maximum wattage of all individual\ndevices. Billing of ancillary device service will be assigned to and made the responsibility of the primary\ncustomer of record that is obtaining service from the electric distribution system referred to as direct\nservice. The service to an ancillary device or device assembly will require the installation of a Company\napproved disconnect device and the appropriate electrical circuit grounding. The Company\u2019s electric\nservice responsibilities associated with ancillary device service will be consistent with the service quality\nand reliability provided to outdoor lighting service consistent with the Company\u2019s scheduled service\nresponse. Unauthorized devices will be considered the responsibility of the primary customer of record\nfrom which the service used by the device is provided and shall be managed and/or terminated in\ncompliance with the applicable provisions of the tariff or Attachment Agreement. Unmetered service under\nthis provision may be terminated by any responsible party per the applicable provisions of this tariff or the\nterms and conditions of the Attachment Agreement provided written notice is issued to all parties no less\nthan 30 days prior to termination.\nIssued by Sally Librera, President, Syracuse, NY\nStatus: EFFECTIVE\nReceived: 01/27/2022 Effective Date: 02/01/2022\nPSC NO: 220 ELECTRICITY LEAF: 372.1\nNIAGARA MOHAWK POWER CORPORATION REVISION: 1\nINITIAL EFFECTIVE DATE: FEBRUARY 1, 2022 SUPERSEDING REVISION:\nSTAMPS: Issued in Compliance with Order in Case 20-E-0380, issued January 20, 2022.\nSERVICE CLASSIFICATION NO. 2 (Continued)\nC.

For SC-7 Phase-in Customers the rate will be SC-7 Phase-in Contract Demand Rate\nbilled to the customer as of October 1 of the year in which the Credit is determined. The Credit will be applied to\nthe customer\u2019s successive 12 monthly customer bills commencing in November until the following October.\nA customer seeking the Credit must request such credit by October 14, in writing, of each year for which the\nreliability credit it sought and, at the same time, specify the Outage Events the customer requests to be excluded\nfrom the Defined Measurement Period. If October 14 falls on a weekend or holiday, the Company will accept\nrequests until the next business day.\nIf a Standby Customer takes service under SC-7 Special Provision I, the Outage Events for all Recipient Accounts\nshall be the same and shall be specified by the Sponsor.

Service under this Service Classification is primarily intended for residential customers residing in individual\ndwelling units.\n1. When minor professional or commercial operations are conducted within the individual dwelling unit,\nservice under this Service Classification will be permitted providing all of the following three qualifications\nare met:\na. The minor professional or commercial operations must be exclusively by the residential\ncustomer residing at the individual dwelling unit served. Use of the professional or commercial area\nby another professional person or persons in addition to the resident disqualifies the customer to\nreceive Electric Service or Electricity Supply Service under this Service Classification.\nb. The area used by the minor professional or commercial operations does not exceed 50 percent\nof the total cubical content of the individual dwelling unit.\nc. Not more than two (2) rooms of any size are contained within the 50 percent cubical content of\nthe area used for professional or commercial operations.\nResidential customers having professional or commercial operations within an individual dwelling unit that\ndo not meet all of the three qualifications must take service under the General Service Classification. Such\ncustomers, however, can elect to separate the electrical use between the residential area and the area used for\nprofessional or commercial operations and to have the Company set an additional meter. The meter used to\nmeasure the electrical use in the professional or commercial operations area will be billed under the General\nService Classification.\nB. Customers, in good standing, have the option with the consent of the Company of paying for service under the\nCompany's Monthly Budget Plan. The plan covers up to twelve months billing and can be started at the\ncustomer's option either with the next bill or as of the last bill. If the customer starts budget billing as of the last\nbill, the last bill is canceled and rebilled under budget billing. The initial budget amount is based on an average\nof the preceding twelve months of actual and estimated energy related charges.\nMonthly budget amounts are reviewed on a ongoing basis and may be changed, as needed, to produce level\nbudget billings through the end of the budget period. The difference between the actual and billed charges will\nbe maintained as a deferred balance. If the Customer decides to end involvement with the program or end\nservice with the Company, the deferred balance will be settled or rolled over for all customers in the twelfth\nmonth.\nBudget bills are due and payable. Full payment must be received on or before the date shown on the bill to\navoid a late payment charge of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) pursuant to Rule 26.4. If the customer fails to\npay the monthly Budget Amount or upon discontinuance of service, the Monthly Budget Payment Plan will be\ncanceled and any deficiency shall be due and payable at once, including any late payment charges assessed.\nAny overpayment shall be credited to the customer's account. The customer can cancel the plan at any time\neffective with the customer\u2019s next regularly scheduled billing.\nThe Company will make available a budget brochure explaining how the Monthly Budget Payment Plan works.\nIssued by Sally Librera, President, Syracuse, NY\nStatus: EFFECTIVE\nReceived: 08/27/2025 Effective Date: 09/01/2025\nPSC NO: 220 ELECTRICITY LEAF: 352\nNIAGARA MOHAWK POWER CORPORATION REVISION: 2\nINITIAL EFFECTIVE DATE: SEPTEMBER 1, 2025 SUPERSEDING REVISION: 0\nSTAMPS: Issued in Compliance with Order in Case 24-E-0322, dated August 14, 2025.\nSERVICE CLASSIFICATION NO. 1 (Continued)\nSPECIAL PROVISIONS (CONT.)\nC.
